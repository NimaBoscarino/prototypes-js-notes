How can objects be created in Javascript?

## Object literal

```js
let potato = {
  flavour: 'delicious'
}
```

## Function Constructor

```js
function Dog(colour) {
  this.colour = colour;
  this.paws = 4;
  this.tail = "waggy";
}
```

Object Oriented Programming

- having blueprints for things
- building things that follow those blueprints
- we can make new blueprints from old blueprints

Classes of with Function Constructors... doesn't matter

Blueprint for a building

- frame
- foundation
- electrical + plumbing
- property taxes
- walls

House extending the blueprint for Buildings

- own front door
- backyard
- garage
- dining room
- closet
- yappy dog next door

nimasHouse
  - 3 glasses
  - a huge fridge
  - heated water
kristensHouse
  - no things
timsHouse

nimasHouse gets flooded

OBJECTS - Prototypes which are very loose, not strict, free-flowing
